# Chess Game (C++ & Qt)

A simple **Chess Game** built with **C++** and the **Qt** framework.  
The project demonstrates object-oriented design, GUI programming with Qt, and the implementation of core chess logic (legal moves, check, checkmate, castling, promotion, and en-passant).

---

## Overview
This project is a desktop Chess Game application that allows two players to play chess in **offline (local)** or **online** modes.  
It provides a user-friendly Qt-based interface and implements the official chess rules, move validation, and logging of played moves for analysis.
